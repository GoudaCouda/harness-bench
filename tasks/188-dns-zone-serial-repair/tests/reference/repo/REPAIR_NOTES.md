# Repair DNS zone serial update ordering repair notes

The repaired `plan_dns_zone_serial` follows the documented timeline contract for RFC 1982 serial arithmetic, primary epochs, stale transfers, refreshes, and wraparound. It preserves stable identity ordering, rejects malformed and duplicate input, separates missing evidence from explicit values, and leaves protected input unchanged.

Verification: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passed, `python3 bin/run_repair.py` completed, and `out/result.json` was re-opened and parsed. Boundary cases include precedence overlap, exact limits, stale or conflicting state, deterministic replay, and fail-closed invalid input. This was an offline local repair; no external service, production mutation, deployment, message, or irreversible action was performed.
